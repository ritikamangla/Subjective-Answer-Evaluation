Explain the concept of cost plus pricing.

Cost plus pricing involves adding a certain percentage to cost in order to fix the price.
For instance, if the cost of a product is Rs 200 per unit and the marketer expects 10 per cent profit on costs, then the selling price will be Rs. 220.
The difference between the selling price and the cost is the profit.
This method is simpler as marketers can easily determine the costs and add a certain percentage to arrive at the selling price.
